		<td>Maintain and clean the grills. Maintain clean burner ports, and periodically check for leaks using a 50/50 mixture of water and dish soap on the hose and its connections. Never leave a grill unattended while it's in use, and keep it away from vinyl siding, fences, and other combustible objects. Baking soda or a fire extinguisher should be used to put out a grease fire. Water will simply make the fire worse.</td>

	<td>Keep garbage, mounds of leaves, and firewood out of the house. These items next to your house could easily be used as kindling if a grass fire develops nearby. Keep hot ashes in a metal container and store them far from your house and garage. Never dump them inside or close to your home.</td>
